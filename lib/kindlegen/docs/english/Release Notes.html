<pre>
	   - Support for converting XMDF file format has been added. Refer Kindle Publishing Guidelines for more info.

Epub3 toc nav element is preferred over NCX navMap element, if both are given. But if the Nav HTML is not specified according to the specification, we will try to fall back to NCX if one exists. If we cannot fallback to NCX, then we would error out. Refer <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-contentdocs-20111011.html#sec-xhtml-nav-def-types-toc">here</a> for more info about EPUB3 toc nav specification.

<h3>Kindlegen version 2.7 build 1019-d6e4792</h3>
<pre>
	   - Data URI support for images and embedded fonts so that they can be referred directly in HTML and CSS files (For more details about data uri, please refer http://dataurl.net).
	   - Enabled support for JP vertical rendering and multiple writing modes.  Values can be specified in OPF files using meta tags (ex: &lt;meta name=”primary-writing-mode” content=”vertical-rl” /&gt;).  The valid values are horizontal-lr, vertical-lr, horizontal-rl, vertical-rl.
	   - Enabled support for facing pages and double page spreads. Values can be specified in OPF through “properties” attribute in itemref tag. The valid values are facing-page-left, facing-page-right, page-spread-left, page-spread-right.
	   - Added Mobi7 support for HTML tags with multiple classes (e.g., class="class1 class2 class3")
	   - KindleGen errors out when original resolution metadata is not specified in the format "integer x integer" for fixed format books.

</pre>

<h3>Kindlegen version 2.5 build 0626-3a91e28</h3>
<pre>
	   - Improved transparent PNG conversion: Transparent PNG images (now converted to JPEG) will use white background. This originally used black background during conversion causing degraded reading experience.
	   - Unintended line breaks in Mobi7 when using some CSS properties (“margin-top: 0px” and “margin-bottom: 0px”) has been fixed.
	   - Resolved indentation issues in Mobi7 related to bullets and numbered lists. This was due to usage of "margin-left" CSS property with bullets and numbered lists. In Mobi7, the margin-left property is being ignored for bullets and numbered lists. The margin-left CSS property will continue to be preserved in KF8.
	   - Fixed issues related to creating Mobi7 books with indexes (eg. Dictionaries) 
	   - CSS property “display: none” no longer induces an additional space in Mobi7 for inline tags.
	   - Embedded fonts of type PostScript/Type1 does not render well across all Kindle readers with KF8 support. Kindlegen warns about the usage of these fonts in content.  Kindlegen also defaults the user experience to system fonts in such books (specifically for eInk devices).  
	   - Kindlegen gracefully ignores the EPUB3 navigation document (specified using properties=”nav” in manifest) and does not add them to the reading order of the book by default.
	   - Resolved conversion failure when dc:Language tag in OPF has attributes (ex: id attribute).
	   - Resolved issue in building logical TOC due to empty text tags or self-closing text tags in NCX file.
	   - Resolved issue in removing CSS properties that are not supported by Kindle (ex: line-height in px/pt units). Kindlegen removed the trailing “}” in a specific edge case when this was the last property and does not have a trailing semicolon. The issue is fixed in Kindlegen 2.5.
	   - Updated “–releasenotes” option in Kindlegen to point the users to detailed release notes hosted on the web at https://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/manual.html.

	   with the wrong trailing bytes format. !!!

	  - prcgen is now built in unicode 
	  - now supports &lt;output encoding= /&gt; in &lt;x-metadata&gt; section, to specify the 
	    exact output encoding (windows-1252 and utf-8 only supported, everything 
	    else than that is transformed to utf-8) 

<h3>V 4.8.7b </h3>
	  - added support for named inflections through &lt;idx:infl&gt; tag 

<h3>V 4.8.7 </h3>
	  - added ASP and embedded objects index 
	  - added -lowpriority 

<h3>V 4.8.6 </h3>
	  - better statistics reporting at the end of the build 
	  - fixed ASSERTion failed bug with fencing info in trailing bytes 

<h3>V 4.8.5c </h3>
	  - bug fix: in &lt;SELECT&gt; tags, default value was not computed if there was no 
	    selected attribute found on any option; value was not decoded from HTML 
	   TODO decoding works only for Western (based on indexes code)
	  - added warnings if SELECT multiple is used 

<h3>V 4.8.5b </h3>
	  - added several checks of javascript code (global function) to avoid crashes of prcgen 
	  - added a constraint on global function (must be prefixed with f_) to avoid 
	    DOM problem later. 

<h3>V 4.8.5 </h3>
	  - added the &lt;x-metadata&gt;&lt;DefaultLookupIndex&gt; field in the .OPF 
	    (used to define the index used for lookup) 

<h3>V 4.8.4b </h3>
	  - mbp:persistent is handled by prcgen on &lt;FORM&gt; tag 
	    (to make forms saved in settings) 
	  - improved the computation of is_reachable on frameset 

<h3>V 4.8.4 </h3>
	  - mbp:auto-submit is handled by prcgen (to make enter key validate a form if 
	    in a text field) 

<h3>V 4.8.2 </h3>
	  - bug fix: it was possible to have closing/opening frameset with exactly the 
	    same position. bug occured when a sub-frameset of a necessary frameset 
	    was actually not AND had exactly the same position as an opening frameset 
	  - changed form must have unique name from error to warning, generating a 
	    random name and replacing this name in indexes and in content 

<h3>V 4.8.1 </h3>
	  - added basic CSS 1.0 support (by generating HTML tags corresponding to CSS) 
	  - added Microsoft OPF support: 
	    page break after each HTML file,  
	    add non spine manifest HTML files at the end of the spine,  
	    generate cover image at the beginning of the spine, based on custom MS guide items 
	    suppress other MS specific guide items 

<h3>V 4.8.0 </h3>
	  - new index tagging syntax: 
	      &lt;idx:entry name=&gt;    (instead of type=) 
	      &lt;idx:key name=&gt;      (instead of type=) 
	      &lt;idx:key value=&gt;     (instead of key=) 
	      &lt;idx:orth value=&gt;    (instead of orth=) 
	      &lt;idx:gramgrp value=&gt; (instead of gramgrp=) 
	  - more database functions added: &lt;idx:subentry&gt; and &lt;idx:string&gt; 
	  - &lt;mbp:pagebreak crossable=no&gt; is now handled through trailing bytes 

<h3>V 4.7.7 </h3>
	  - added javascript global function index 

<h3>V 4.7.6 </h3>
	  - current entry information apended to text records =&gt; switch to FFV_6 
	  - non-crossable page breaks are also appended to text records 
	  - all PRCs generated with FFV_6 must be encrypted through NEW VERSIONS of 
	    DRM software 

<h3>V 4.7.5 </h3>
	  - added ability to append .PDB files through manifest items 
	    (application/x-pilot)	you must add them too in the spine if the order of 
	    insertion in final PRC file 
	  - added guard record (allows to checks for file truncation) 

	   tbr
	  - disable C++ execption handling in PRCGEN.exe in image handling classes 
	    (would cause JPEG images to be completely black) 

<h3>V 4.7.4 </h3>
	  - bug fix: problem related to loading files by chunks of more than 32MB 
	    (probably a bug of Windows) 

<h3>V 4.7.3 </h3>
	  - bug fix: indexes would not be stripped from child files in some rare cases 
	  - bug fix: removed an infinite loop (+infinite memory alloation) if a string 
	    pool exceeded 64k. 

<h3>V 4.7.2 </h3>
	  - added user-selection attribute to slave-frames so that some frames can 
	    contain selectable content (generally not useful, but some publishers put 
	    content in frames) 

<h3>V 4.7.1 </h3>
	  - show error message for missing images only once, for bad links too 
	  - do not encrypt any more trailing bytes of text records when HuffDic activated 
	    so that reader works. 
	  - updated forms to save all but positional info for in slave-frames forms 
	  - detect forms with same name and refuses to build 
	  - if errors are detected during parsing (preventing generation of the file) 
	    build stops before compression 

<h3>V 4.7.0 </h3>
	  - changed version to match the release of Reader 4.7 
	  - added start type item in guide to start eBook at a given url / javascript 
	    action 

<h3>V 4.6.11 </h3>
	  - name and id attributes are not removed anymore if an href or onclick 
	    attribute is also found in the tag. Using name or id is the standard 
	    HTML mechanism for naming links and using them in Javascript. Therefore, 
	    the reader needs these attributes. 

<h3>V 4.6.10 </h3>
	  - fixed bug preventing frames declared in a (unnecessary) file frameset when 
	    using the filename.htm link 
	  - bug fix: prevent multiple framesets at same filepos 
	  - note: detected some problem if the outer frameset is non crossable, and not 
	    the inner frameset. It cannot be coded ==&gt; problem does not occur because it 
	    could only happen for file auto-frameset and this one is always crossable 
	    for now 

<h3>V 4.6.9 </h3>
	  - UTF8 trailing bytes were ignored when aligning records, so that following 
	    record were potentially badly aligned (crash on PocketPCs) 

<h3>V 4.6.8 </h3>
	  - bug fix: non crossable attribute was ignored due to optimizations 

<h3>V 4.6.7 </h3>
	  - added reader pro restriction, fixed some small bug in FDST record writing 

<h3>V 4.6.6 </h3>
	  - added layout reuse and unreachable frameset rejection code, it does not 
	    change file format but may greatly reduce size of frame layout/content 
	    records. 

<h3>V 4.6.5 </h3>
	  - better error reporting on save failure in apply-xsl plugin 
	  - bug fix: in books with only mbp:sections 
	    (frameset info not saved =&gt; non crossable ignored) 

<h3>V 4.6.4 </h3>
	  - prc was always generated in FFV5, as soon as there was one frame (because of 
	    the auto-breadth parameter always set to true) 

<h3>V 4.6.3 </h3>
	  - huffdic compression temporary file bug fixed (which was probably causing 
	    other bugs) 

<h3>V 4.6.2 </h3>
	  - added support for basic support of UTF8, no indexes yet 

<h3>V 4.6.1 </h3>
	  - added tests and error reporting on write errors to temp file during Huffman 
	    codes output
